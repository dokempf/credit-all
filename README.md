## What is this project about and why is it important?
There is no one size fits all system for capturing all of the contributions during different research projects. This could be a scientific research project, a software development project or an open-source community project.

We think it is important that all contributions are recorded and therefore everyone is given credit for their work more fairly.

### The problem
Current systems that attribute contributions to authors in academic outputs do not include all of the jobs/roles/tasks that are encompassed in research projects.

The current problems include:
* Capturing all roles on a project.
* Capturing all tasks within those roles.
* How to convert this into the actual authorship or contributions list that can be used for project outputs.
* How this list can be presented.

### The solution
Taking inspiration from Malin Sandstroms Lightning talk at the Software Sustainability Institutes Collaboration Workshop 2021, in which she proposed to combine the current contributions approaches.

*Slide from Malin Sandstrom's SSI talk*

In this project, we propose to:
* Expand current lists to be more inclusive - using current systems such as CRediT, INRIA, BIDS Contributors.
* Develop a tool to be used to record these contributions during the project such as within a Github repository. This tool builds on the established [All Contributor](https://allcontributors.org/) specification for recording contributions but adds a few extras that we consider especially valueable in a scientific context:
  * Renderings of your contributors list are embeddable into a wide range of documents, not only on the web, but also in e.g. publications
  * Custom templates can be provided
  * Pre-generated list of contribution types/contributor roles from a the scientific world
  * Python-based command line interface tool
* Develop a way that this can be shown on academic papers - lists, table, cinema title page? (look at e.g. Brainhack paper w 100+ authors and Living with machines).

## Installation

You can install the command line tool using pip:

```
python -m pip install git+git://github.com/dokempf/credit-all.git
```
